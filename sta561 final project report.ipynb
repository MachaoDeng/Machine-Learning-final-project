    "League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. In League of Legends, players assume the role of a \"champion\" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other player or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's \"Nexus\", a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the first ten minutes information of each game at \"diamond\" ranking, which is a very high competitive level in the LoL. The reason for only choosing diamond ranking games is because the players in this level are less likely to make faults, which proves the objectivity of data and decrease the negative affection brought by the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes nearly 10000 obervations and 40 features that record the information for the blue and red team of each game. In this project, we are going to divide the dataset into train and test set. We plan to build several machine learning models we have learned in this class based on train set and assess our models on the test set. Another purpose is to find the difference among the the different models.  "

    "1. Guassian Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Guassian Process Classifier uses Bayes Theorem to extrapolate the posterior probability $P(C_{k}|x)$, where $C_{k}$ represents class k and $x$ is a featured vector that has a Guassian (univariate or multivariate) prior. Guassian Process is that we can place priors over parameters using a kernel and evaluate the variance of parameters. During the Guassian Process, the differnet kernel will give us different outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, we first delete some duplicated information such as \"blue team gold difference\" and \"red team gold differnece\" since they actually represent the same thing. Then, we choose the first 8000 obervations as train data and the rest of the observations as test data. We build our Guassian Process model on train data, treating the variable \"blueWins\" as the target variable and the rest of features as train variables. In the mean time, we have tried many different kernels for this problem and we find out Radial-basis function (RBF) works best. Finally, the error rate on test set is 27.9%."

    "$$\n",
